# ADR 0002 - Migrate PATSy database to PostgreSQL

Date: March 6, 2023

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The PATSy database is currently stored in an SQLite instance, with these
properties:

1. Database updates and rollbacks are easy in theory, by creating new copies of
   the file.

2. Due to the growing size of the database it is becoming more difficult to
   transfer file copies over the network for backup purposes and to support
   updates by multiple agents.

3. Automated updates would be difficult to configure and maintain.

[LIBITD-1754](https://umd-dit.atlassian.net/browse/LIBITD-1754)

## Decision

We will migrate the PATSy database to a PostgreSQL instance running in the
Kubernetes cluster. This will support a larger database size, multi-user access
for reads and writes, automatic backups, and DTAP environments.

## Consequences

We must take greater care to test and coordinate database schema rollouts with
`patsy` program updates.

We will make database backups automatic but require manual intervention if we
need to roll the database back to previous versions.
